= Requirements =

* WordPress 4.7 or later.


== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server (in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory).
2. Activate the My Youtube Recommendation plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of ThemeGrill Demo Importer, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “My Youtube Recommendation” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our demo importer plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our demo importer plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Shortcodes ==

A basic shortcode will embed your video gallery using your default profile settings. However, you may wish customize things - this is done via parameters added to the shortcode.

e.g. `[my_youtube limit=3 layout=list]`

Which options are available depends upon the users's set-up.

* **limit** - number of videos that will be showed on list, max. 15 (default 3). 
* **layout** - *list* or *grid*. The layout for the gallery (default grid).

== Widgets ==

Widgets can be easily added. In Administration simply click on the Widgets option under the Appearance menu. My YouTube Recommendation will be one of the listed widgets. Drag it to the appropriate sidebar on the right hand side and then choose your options.
